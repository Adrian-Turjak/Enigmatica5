		minecolonies-0.11.867-ALPHA-universal.jar:
			Minecolonies Changelog
			Version: 0.11.867-ALPHA
			* Raiders and other Fixes (#4711)
			Add support for random pirate ship rotations, disabled for now till spawners are within schematics. Add pathing options, which contains stuff like custom weights and wether swimming/rails etc is allowed Raiders have a lower height cost, and pirates a lower swim cost. Added water-enter cost, which is high and reduced water cost when already swimming
			Fix: Raids initial spawn position got reworked, no longer spawns in the middle of a colony and is more randomly distributed now. The spawn pos is more dynamic now depending on loaded buildings and keeps a min distance to buildings. Fix: replace deprecated isBlockLoaded with isBlockPresent Fix: Pirates spawning on the very top of their ships Fix: Lumberjack now does cut down leaves in his way, previously he was stuck in pathing before trying to do so. Fix: Water pathing sometimes running off, due to our paths beeing 1block above the water and the entity getting stuck in jumping, no longer accepting other movement. Fix: Pathing jumps with slabs & co Fix: Pathing not working when the destination wasnt reached, now uses the closes node. Fix: Pathing not properly flagging the starting node as swimming/rails Fix: Pathing sometimes early-outing a different node than intended, causing iffy pathing occasionally Fix: Error upon placing townhall with building tool and no colony
