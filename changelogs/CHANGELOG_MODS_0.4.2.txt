			Implements #2121
			Changes proposed in this pull request: Added a Stash, that will have items inside that the DeliveryMan will pickup and move to the Warehouse. So, this incomplete PR is an attempt to implement #2121 , although just the first comment, as the second one I felt it was beyond the scope of the Stash, as I thought this should be kept to a minimal functionality.
			Core Functionality The Core functionality of how I thought was this: when an item gets deposited, it bumps the priority up to 10, to encourage the DeliveryMan to pickup items ASAP on them. When the DeliveryMan picks up the items, it drops the priority to a minimum. So the bumping and the dropping are being handled by the TileEntity and the Inventory Handler.
			Found issues I noticed that the dropping of the priority should be done automatically, but it's only done when it's the last building on the list? I didn't quite understand why this didn't work:

			* Stash #2121 (#4545)
			First, thanks for this great mod! I loved playing with it, so I wanted to give back a little!
			Implements #2121
			Changes proposed in this pull request: Added a Stash, that will have items inside that the DeliveryMan will pickup and move to the Warehouse. So, this incomplete PR is an attempt to implement #2121 , although just the first comment, as the second one I felt it was beyond the scope of the Stash, as I thought this should be kept to a minimal functionality.
			Core Functionality The Core functionality of how I thought was this: when an item gets deposited, it bumps the priority up to 10, to encourage the DeliveryMan to pickup items ASAP on them. When the DeliveryMan picks up the items, it drops the priority to a minimum. So the bumping and the dropping are being handled by the TileEntity and the Inventory Handler.
			Found issues I noticed that the dropping of the priority should be done automatically, but it's only done when it's the last building on the list? I didn't quite understand why this didn't work:
