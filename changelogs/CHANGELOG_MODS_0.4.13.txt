			1.2.0-20 (18 May 2020)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.15/Changelog.md#known-issues)Known Issues
			* There is an incompatibility with the version 1.15.2-10m and older of the Performant mod, which (with default settings) will mess up Drone pathfinding
			* - Using Performant 1.15.20-11m (not released at time of writing) or newer fixes the problem
			* - Alternatively (for older versions), setting fastPathFinding to false in Performant's config works around the problem
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.15/Changelog.md#new)New
			* ComputerCraft support has returned!
			* - You will need CC:Tweaked, version 1.88.1 or newer. Older releases will not work.
			* - Other than that, it should work pretty much as it did for 1.12.2, although testing has been fairly light so far, so consider this an alpha-level feature.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.15/Changelog.md#updates)Updates
			* Pneumatic Armor can now be repaired in an Anvil with Compressed Iron Ingots (and experience)
			* - Each ingot repairs 16 durability
			* - XP Level cost is (ingots / 2), minimum 1 level
			* - This is in addition to using Item Life upgrades, which still work
			* Drones with Magnet Upgrade now respect Botania's Solegnolia
			* Drones now apply a 40-tick pickup delay to items dropped with the Drop Item widget, same as players do
			* - This avoids problems where Drones with Magnet Upgrades just immediately pick up dropped items again
			* - The delay can be disabled in the Drop Item widget GUI if you need to
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.15/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes
			* Fixed non-fatal startup exceptions being logged when soft-depended mods (e.g. The One Probe) aren't present

			* Several GUI fixes and cleanups:
			* - Fixed widgets with dropdowns (combo box and color selector) often rendering their dropdown under other widgets
			* - Cleaned up the prog widget Area GUI and GPS selection GUI a bit
			* - Fixed Programmer widget tray dragging sometimes selecting a widget under the open tray instead of the widget in the tray

			* The shield will now also consider dolphins, bees, squids, and other neutral creatures as passive

	Ultra Amplified Dimension (Forge) (Ultra Amplified Dimension V.7.4.2 (Forge 1.15.2) --> Ultra Amplified Dimension V.8.0.1 (Forge 1.15.2)):
		Ultra Amplified Dimension V.8.0.1 (Forge 1.15.2):
			(V.8.0.1 Changes) (1.15.2 Minecraft)
			Structures:
			-Added a dummy fortress structure so updating worlds from pre-8.0.0 UA to post-8.0.1 UA will not crash the world. The dummy fortress will be visible in locate command as ultra_amplified_dimension:fortress but will never return a location.
			Mod Compatibility:
			-Added JEI integeration. All UA blocks now has a description page with JEI.
			(V.8.0.0 Changes) (1.15.2 Minecraft)
			Config:
			-The blocks used to make the portal now must specify a block's resource location. They cannot be blank anymore.
			Biomes:
			-Fixed bug where underground lava pools could be exposed floating in caves and ravines in Netherland biome.
			-Cleaned up biome picker code significantly in back end and it should now do better with filling temperature regions that has no biome in it due to blacklisting or config setting. Let me know if any problems arise from this!
			-Slightly reduced ocean size.
			-Slightly increased rarity of landlocked Frozen Desert biome.
			Structure:
			-Split Stone Fortress and Nether Fortress into two separate structures and made the Nether Fortress much more common so it can be found easier in Netherland biomes. /locate command now can distinguish between the two structure. (Also removed useless configs entries due to this split)
			-Fixed bug where swapping Stronebrick/Nether Brick for Stone Fortresses and Nether Fortresses would cause the fortress to start spawning the other fortress's types of mobs.
			-Fix issue with roots decreasing Hanging Ruins' spawnrate. Now Hanging Ruins will ignore roots when looking for the flat parts of the underside of ledges.
			Blocks:
			-Overhauled the glow-variant block textures so they have the Glowstone part be an overlay instead and the base texture can easily be changed with resource packs. You can quickly make and use your own resource packs to replace the Glowstone parts textures used for the overlay too if you wish to make the overlay match a higher resolution resource pack.
			-Improved the Amplified Portal block textures to look much more polished and cool! It is also more compatible with resource packs too.
			Misc:
			-Changed some hardcoded 255 height values to use the world's max height instead. Might help with Cubic Chunk-like mod compatibility but otherwise, users will see no change.

		Ultra Amplified Dimension V.8.0.0 (Forge 1.15.2):
			(V.8.0.0 Changes) (1.15.2 Minecraft)
			NOTE: Do not use v8.0.0 in a world made with older versions of UA!
			Config:
			-The configs for the blocks used to make the portal now must specify a block's resource location. They cannot be blank anymore.
			Biomes:
			-Fixed bug where underground lava pools could be exposed floating in caves and ravines in Netherland biome.
			-Cleaned up biome picker code significantly in back end and it should now do better with filling temperature regions that has no biome in it due to blacklisting or config setting. Let me know if any problems arise from this!
