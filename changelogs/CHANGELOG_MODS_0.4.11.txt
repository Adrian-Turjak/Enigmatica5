	MineColonies (minecolonies-0.11.941-ALPHA-universal.jar --> minecolonies-0.11.945-ALPHA-universal.jar):
		minecolonies-0.11.945-ALPHA-universal.jar:
			Minecolonies Changelog
			Version: 0.11.945-ALPHA
			* Tavern (#4894)

		minecolonies-0.11.944-ALPHA-universal.jar:
			Minecolonies Changelog
			Version: 0.11.944-ALPHA
			* Allow buildings to opt-out from deliveryman (#4973)
			Feature Suggestion Currently, the deliveryman just randomly picks from all gatherable buildings. This PR adds the option to opt-out from the deliveryman. The building will be left alone, except for when pickup requests (i.e. crafting complete) are sent by the building itself. Be careful though, you now have to clean up after the building yourself.
			Implementation Additionally to "Static" and "Automatic", there is now a "Pickup: Never" option. Click it. Slightly changed the GUI of the buildings to better accomodate the new feature. Selecting "Pickup: Never" will hide the Priority numbers / decrementors/incrementors to avoid confusion. image
			image
			Open Considerations I had to change the current "isPriorityStatic()"-boolean to an enum to fit the third state. This means I had to modify the NBT-data where this is stored. I have written a mini-migration/failsafe into the code, so on NBT-load the current data should be loaded, and then on chunksave the new format should be serialized. Since screwing this up would mean a bunch of trouble, please take special note of AbstractBuildingContainer:104 ff.

		minecolonies-0.11.943-ALPHA-universal.jar:
			Minecolonies Changelog
			Version: 0.11.943-ALPHA
			* Schematics115 (#4959)
			Fortress Fletcher Update

		minecolonies-0.11.942-ALPHA-universal.jar:
			Minecolonies Changelog
			Version: 0.11.942-ALPHA
			* Allow certain requests to have a minimum count (#4968)
			This PR basically replaces the previous handling where specific workers were able to make requests that were partially fulfilled with a request specific handling. Thus worker can request something with a count and a min count, where the RS will try to fulfill the count and if this is not possible but the system has a bit less it will try to match the minCount.
			I also removed some of the heavy streams with quicker for loops.
