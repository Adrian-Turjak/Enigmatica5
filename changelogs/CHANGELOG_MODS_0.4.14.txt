			1.2.2-30 (1 Jun 2020)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.15/Changelog.md#new)New
			* Added new Thermal Lagging block, an alternative to covering your Refinery & other heat machines with trapdoors
			* - Thermal Lagging has no collision box unless sneaking or holding a wrench or pickaxe
			* - Makes it easy to "click through" to the machine behind the lagging
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.15/Changelog.md#updates)Updates
			* Small/Medium/Large tanks now have Comparator support to measure their fullness
			* Pressure Mechanic villagers now have some workstation sounds again, as they did in 1.14.4
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.15/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes
			* Fixed Programmable Controller drones being unable to pick up items or pull items from chests
			* Fixed Programmable Controller ignoring its Inventory Upgrades
			* Fixed player kick (and subsequent inability to log back in) caused by middle-clicking non-ammo slots in the Minigun magazine GUI
			* Fixed minor fluid rendering issues in connected tanks (Small/Medium/Large Tank)
			* Fixes to drone pathfinding to hopefully work better with "openable" blocks like trapdoors, doors, etc.
			* - Note that drones still can't properly pathfind through doors and trapdoors but this helps interacting with blocks that are covered with trapdoors
			* Fixed drones losing all their carried fluid when wrenched to item form
			* Fixed Amadrones sometimes dropping their carried items when they suicide
			* - Couldn't reproduce this one myself, but added some extra checks to ensure Amadrones never drop anything on death
			* Fixed programmer GUI widget area clipping issues (sometimes not showing any widgets)
			* - Most obvious when using the "Auto" GUI scale - this is now much more robust
			* Fixed semiblock items (crop sticks, logistics frames etc.) being consumed when placed in creative mode
			* Fixed crop sticks allowing multiple sticks to be placed in the same block space

			* Made the volume of several sounds configurable in client-side config (pneumaticcraft-client.toml)
			* - Miniguns (item, drone & sentry turret)
			* - Air leaks (beware of setting this to silent, it helps tracks leaks in your system!)
			* - Jet Boots (with separate volume level for builder mode)
			* - Elevators
			* Regulator Module (without Advanced PCB) now always regulates to 4.9 bar, even when on Advanced Pressure Tubes
			* - Was a bit pointless having a Regulator which regulated to 19.9 when the point is to regulate down to tier 1
			* - Pressure level is still interpolated from 4.9 down to 0 based on redstone (0 redstone = 4.9 bar, 15 redstone = 0 bar)
			* - Regulators with an Advanced PCB are still fully configurable, as always
			* Elevators are now much easier to build
			* - Elevator Frames are now placed like scaffolding
			* - Right-click a frame against another places it on top, building a tower from the bottom
			* - Sneak-right-click places it normally (if possible)
			* - Elevator Frames will now drop as an item if the block beneath is not an Elevator Base or Elevator Frame
			* - Elevator Frames can now only be placed on an Elevator Base or Elevator Frame
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.15/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes
			* Elevator fixes
			* - Fixed client crash when cycling through floors in Elevator GUI (with no Elevator Callers present)
			* - Fixed Elevator Frames having a player-blocking hitbox with 3x3 or larger elevators
			* Fixed External Program progwidget not doing anything
			* Fixed Safety Tube Module not releasing air when it should
			* Fixed Regulator Module bug which caused excess pressure to build up in their tube section
			* Fixed Refinery Controller block shape (caused x-ray effect with solid adjacent blocks)
			* Fixed client crash when trying to camouflage blocks with Pressure Chamber Glass

			* Drying rack not interacting with some item transfer methods (missing item handler capability) [#55]
			## [0.6.12] - 2020-01-21
			### Removed

			* Drying rack can be waterlogged (will not function when waterlogged)
			* Set minimum Forge version to 28.1.5
			### Fixed

			## [0.6.1] - 2019-09-27
			### Added
			* Canisters, stackable fluid containers (64 per slot). This will hold any fluid, but probably won't be recognized by other mods.
			* Fluid color is currently pulled from some JEI code until I write my own solution. If you report colorless fluids in canisters I will make fun of you :p
			* Pump, picks up fluids from the world. Can fill buckets or canisters. Requires some FE to work
			* Refinery is working
			* Refinery can fill buckets or fluid canisters
			* Temporary refinery textures
			* Plastic pellets and sheets (not craftable yet, we're getting there...)
			## [0.6.0] - 2019-09-23
			Even more recipe work!
			### Added
			* Machine upgrades. Not craftable yet, but 3 of the 4 are functioning. Most machines (except basic ones) will have upgrade slots. Only one upgrade is allowed in each slot, but they can stack elsewhere.
			* Oil, generates in "lakes", usually underground. No function at the moment.
			* Diesel, will be one product of refining oil. Currently no way to produce it.
			* Refinery, not functional. Will refine oil into other fluids. Has a "recipe" system which will allow mods or datapacks to use it.
			### Changed
			* Coal generator now also accepts `forge:nuggets/coal` [#18]
			### Fixed
			* Ores generating in wrong generation stage [#19]
			* Add loot table for basic crusher

			* Yes, the model is broken and the textures are temporary!
			* Currently generates 500K FE per lava bucket (feedback appreciated)
			* Steel recipe [#9]
			* ComputerCraft (CC Tweaked) computers can now read energy levels of machines and generators
			### Changed
			* Generators can now be controlled by redstone like machines (defaults to ignore redstone)
			* Coal generator now accepts only coal and charcoal (`minecraft:coals`) and coal blocks (`forge:storage_blocks/coal`) by default. Override the `silents_mechanisms:coal_generator_fuels` item tag if you need to change this.
			## [0.4.2] - 2019-08-24
			### Added
			* Machines can now be controlled by redstone (defaults to ignore redstone). Does not work on generators yet, expect it next update.
			* Machine frames (no use yet), Electrum
			### Changed
			* Machines are now set to their inactive state (and lose progress) when they run out of power
			### Fixed
			* Alloy smelter matching the wrong recipes
			## [0.4.1] - 2019-08-23

			### Changed
			* Updated Polish translation (Dolores_McDoodle)
			### Fixed
			* Blocks losing their inventory when broken [#4]
			## [0.4.0] - 2019-08-22
			* Big thanks to EnbyChu for making all the textures for this update!
			* This is a very large update (over 400 JSON files) because of the addition of ores. Expect recipes to be changes to use the new metals.
			### Added

			* Polish translation (Dolores_McDoodle)
			## [0.3.4] - 2019-08-18
			### Added
			* Crushing recipes for remaining vanilla ores and Useless Mod ores
			### Fixed
			* Machine energy values displaying incorrectly when playing on a server [#2]
			* Invalidate energy capabilities on removed tile entities [#3]

			* Fixed some rendering issues when breaking facades
			* Fixed the cable blocks being solid
			* Consolidate all cable/facade rendering into GenericCableBakedModel and remove the redundant FacadeBakedModel and everything related to it. This reduces the amount of code that has to be maintained.
			* Fix a possible performance regression in #414 that was pointed out on Discord. Now, the cable quads only get returned in the solid rendering layer, and quads for the mimicked block only get returned if the mimicked block's canRenderInLayer() is true.
			* Allow facade/cable rendering in all layers, ensuring that translucency works in addition to cutouts and solids.
			* Always render the cable even if there is also a facade, so that translucent and cutout blocks show the cable inside.

	Xaero's Minimap (v20.11.0 for Minecraft 1.15.2 --> v20.12.2 for Minecraft 1.15.2):
		v20.12.2 for Minecraft 1.15.2:
			* World/Server/Sub-World/Dimension/Set dropdown menus will now all be numerically and alphabetically sorted. The data used for sorting depends on the dropdown menu.
			* Fixed the color dropdown option on the waypoint add/edit screen not working properly.

		v20.12.1 for Minecraft 1.15.2:
			* Compatibility with Xaero's World Map 1.6.0. Not compatible with older versions.
			* Multiworld detection will now detect the world map mod's current multiworld id, respecting the new manual and single map selection modes.
			* Removed the dimension ids from the subworld selection menu, when the dimension name is available, because it causes confusion while not being that useful.
			* Fixed the selected sub-world shown in the dropdown menu in the waypoints screen not representing the contents of the waypoints list, when you select the displayed automatic subworld while the actual automatic subworld has changed already in the background.
			* Dropdown menus will now shorten text lines that are too long.
			* Fixed waypoint world/server also not changing after a non-auto dimension/sub-world is selected.
			* Improved dropdown menus so that they now display the current selection at its original slot too, not just at the top of the list. Makes going through the list a whole lot easier.
			* Fixed the minimap processes being paused when the world map screen is open.
			* Fixed some text lines being cut short by depth testing when using some resource packs. This includes ingame waypoints, entity name tags on the minimap and potentially other UI elements.
			* Moved key binding registration to parallel mod loading. Should fix compatibility with some mods.

	Xaero's World Map (v1.5.7 for Minecraft 1.15.2 --> v1.6.2 for Minecraft 1.15.2):
		v1.6.2 for Minecraft 1.15.2:
			* Fixed compatibility with fake worlds (again). For example, this fixes compatibility with bspkrsCore.
			+ Added a line of text above the map selection dropdown menu, so it's more clear what it is.
			* The map selection dropdown list should now be alphabetically sorted.

		v1.6.1 for Minecraft 1.15.2:
			* Compatibility with Xaero's Minimap (or Better PVP) 20.12.0. Not compatible with older versions.
			+ Added a map selection/control screen for multiplayer servers/realms. It can be opened by clicking the new button in the bottom left corner of the world map screen. You should no longer have to go through map data files to manage multiple world maps on the same server address. This will work similar to "Make Sub-World Auto" from the minimap mod when using the world spawn-based map selection mode.
			+ Added a "Map Selection" option to the map selection screen. It lets you choose the map selection mode used on the current server address.
			+ Added "Manual" map selection mode as the new default mode. In this mode, you are asked to select and confirm the world map to "write" to every time you switch worlds/dimensions. You can also use a key binding to quickly confirm the last confirmed map for the entered dimension. This mode is only useful on servers with multiple worlds/sub-servers.
			+ Added "Single" map selection mode. This mode essentially treats the server like a singleplayer world. No manual confirmation is required and no issues should be caused by world spawn-based map selection. This is the equivalent on having "Multiworld Detection" set to OFF in the minimap mod.
			+ Added "World Spawn" map selection mode. This is the old automatic and problematic multiworld detection you're used to. However, you can now choose what world map is bound to your current world spawn by using the map selection screen. So, if the world spawn changes for some reason, you can easily bring back any world map you need and bind it to the new world spawn.
			* Fixed freeze on world join / dimension change when the entered map is very large.
			* Fixed some multiplayer map regions not saving properly when switching between worlds/servers very quickly.
			* Fixed world spawn-based detection not working properly on some servers.
			* The world map screen should now always show the correct waypoints for the viewed map, instead of showing the ones selected in the minimap mod.
			* Fixed backwards compatibility with old non-compressed map data files.
			* Performance improvements.
