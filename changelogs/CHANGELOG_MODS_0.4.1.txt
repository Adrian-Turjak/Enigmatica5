			[9294e3e](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/9294e3ecb774dd2dd4cface80e8142067af3735f) - Rewrite how mode changing for items works internally, and change it so using the mode change key makes the mode go forwards, and holding shift (sneak) and using the mode change key makes it go back one mode (note: this is how it used to go forwards) [#5833](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5833) - Moved atomic disassembler to using the mode change key rather than sneak right clicking - Added support for scrolling for all mode items that get used in your hand - Added a few more lang keys for when modes change, and changed a couple lang keys slightly to be more "unified" - Changed key bindings to set their "category" as the localization string for Mekanism rather than directly as Mekanism - Made mode change keys only get tracked when not in GUIs - Added changeable keybinds for showing machine descriptions [#5158](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5158)

[#5747](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5747) Eventually we may try to further improve it so it draws lines at angles and such, but for now this is a quick and easy way to massively improve the FPS
			[a27ae7e](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/a27ae7e8a4abbfda60d902d1ce2e770fdf051435) - Define a way to sync less information on non initial update packets. Use this to do the initial sync for what is in the contents of pressurized tubes, mechanical pipes, and universal cables
