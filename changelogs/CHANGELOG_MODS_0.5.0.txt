		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.15.2-1.3.0-33.jar:
			1.3.0-33 (12 Jun 2020)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.15/Changelog.md#updates)Updates
			* Logistics Core recipe has been changed to create two cores instead of one
			* Some drone pathfinding optimisation, in particular reducing server-side CPU usage when drones can't find a path
			* - Added some checks to cull a lot of unnecessary pathing searches
			* Small visual improvement for the Omnidirection & Liquid Hopppers
			* - Output spout is slightly narrower, and the output end is a little darker
			* Pastebin GUI: added "Pretty?" option to control pretty-printing of JSON output to Pastebin/clipboard
			* - Default is now not to pretty-print JSON, so saved drone programs & remote layouts are a lot more compact
			* Redstone Module I/O direction can now be configured in the module's GUI
			* - This does not require an Advanced PCB to be installed
			* - Toggling I/O with a Wrench still works too, as it used to
			* Drones (both entity and item form) now show their carried fluid, if any
			* - Shown in item tooltip for drones in item form
			* - Shown in TOP/Waila display for drone entities
			* It's now possible to attach levers/buttons/etc. to the side of camouflaged blocks (assuming the camouflage is solid, of course)
			* - This is particularly nice for camouflaged Pressure Tubes with Redstone Modules
			* Elevators with Charging Upgrades installed will now only add air back if it's safe to do so (pressure < 4.9 bar)
			* Some Micromissiles improvements
			* - Micromissiles now do more damage on direct entity hit (explosion position was further from the target entity than it should have been)
			* - Micromissiles can now be "repaired" in an Anvil with TNT (1 TNT restores 25 missile shots)
			* - Micromissile smoke particles are a bit less dense now
			* - Reduced default cooldown time from 15 ticks to 10 ticks (still adjustable in config)
			* Some Sentry Turret improvements
			* - Default entity filter for newly placed Sentry Turrets is now @mob - avoids pain & suffering if players load the turret and forget to set a filter
			* - Fixed the entity filter string not showing in GUI the first time it's opened
			* - Better filter validation and error display in the GUI
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.15/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes
			* Fixed Charging Stations at 0 bar not being able to discharge pressure from items into the station
			* Drones should be able to place blocks much more reliably now
			* Fixed Drones (and other entities) sometimes getting badly confused while trying to path across or through some PneumaticCraft blocks
			* - Blocks were wrongly reporting themselves suitable for pathing through, when their hitbox actually didn't allow it
			* Fixed the clientside drama_splash config option not being properly honoured when set to false
			* Some Programmer GUI fixes:
			* - Fixed widget area dragging behaviour when dragging items from inventory slots across it
			* - Fixed Area widgets in the programmer GUI not being sync'd to server when clicked with a GPS (or Area GPS) Tool
			* - Fixed Area widgets jumping position when clicked with a GPS or Area GPS tool in the programmer
			* - Fixed Pastebin communication (now using HTTPS exclusively, looks like HTTP is no longer accepted)
			* Fixed client crash caused by wrongly attempting to send some server->client sync packets
			* - Caused sometimes when breaking off camouflage blocks
			* Performance fix: Omnidirectional and Liquid Hoppers were causing some unnecessary block updates when their comparator output level changed
			* Fixed Omnidirectional Hopper comparator output being inaccurate under certain circumstances
			* All translation keys are now properly namespaced
			* - No player-visible change here but eliminates the risk of translation key clashes with other mods
			* Electrostatic Compressor item tooltip is much shorter now (long tooltip still visible in JEI and GUI side tab)

	Quark (Quark-r2.1-243.jar --> Quark-r2.1-245.jar):
		Quark-r2.1-245.jar:
			* Added Endergetic Bolloon Bud to the piston blacklist since it wasn't compatible.
			* Extended the black screen a bit (til July 15th up from July 1st)
			* Fixed a crash when the language manager is missing.
			* Fixed crabs not dropping crab shells.
			* Fixed incorrect transparency on some pixels with bee skins.
			* Fixed sign edit breaking the sign button mod.
			* Fixed slime in a bucket being emptied if used in creative.
			* Fixed some blocks with particles not emitting particles when very far out into the world.
			* Made the q button rainbow during june

		Quark-r2.1-244.jar:
			Tweaked the black screen a bit:
			* The message will now only show up once per instance. It used to show up once per run, but I quickly realized that showing people the same message over and over isn't exactly going to lead to great results.
			* Tweaked the text a bit to be more factual.
			* Changed the order in which the message appears to help create less confusion. Previously the skip info would only show after a pause, which would make people confused.
			* Added a time killswitch, the message will automatically stop showing up for everyone after the 1st of July. This may be extended in future versions if need be, but this should be good for now.
			* If you're a modpack maker, and you do not want the message shipped, include /saves/.quark/.blm_marker in your files. I'd rather you didn't, but I also understand it's somewhat hypocritical to rail on mods with player banning code and not give pack makers an option here.
