	Ultra Amplified Dimension (Forge) (Ultra Amplified Dimension V.7.3.1 (Forge 1.15.2) --> Ultra Amplified Dimension V.7.4.2 (Forge 1.15.2)):
		Ultra Amplified Dimension V.7.4.2 (Forge 1.15.2):
			(V.7.4.2 Changes) (1.15.2 Minecraft)
			Misc:
			-Fixed crash in production on servers due to me not using the right method name for a reflection. Sorry about that!
			(V.7.4.1 Changes) (1.15.2 Minecraft)
			Worldtype:
			-Quick fix to stop a crash when trying to sleep in the UA dimension when using the UA worldtype.
			(V.7.4.0 Changes) (1.15.2 Minecraft)
			Dimension:
			-Ultra Amplified Dimension now has it's own time behind the scenes! Everyone in that specific dimension must sleep together to set the time to day. The /time command now also works in that dimension as well. Rain and thunder time is still locked into the Overworld's rain and thunder time and sleeping in UA dimension will clear the weather for Overworld as well.
			-Sleeping in a bed will now automatically wake you up if everyone in the dimension is sleeping.
			Worldtype:
			-When using the Ultra Amplified worldtype, the Ultra Amplified Dimension now will use the Overworld Dimension stuff in backend and looks like an exact copy of the Overworld! Making an Amplified Portal in the Ultra Amplified worldtype will teleport you between the Overworld Dimension that looks Ultra Amplified and the Ultra Amplified Dimension that looks like the Overworld.
			Config:
			-Added a new option to let you specify any item for creating the portal! The portalActivationItem entry is set to minecraft:flint_and_steel by default. If set to "", the portal creation will be disabled.
			-portalCornerBlocks, portalCeilingBlocks, and portalFloorBlocks config entries will now be made with the resourcelocation of their default blocks instead of being blank.
			-Added an option to allow Nether Portals to be created in Ultra Amplified Dimension as an alternative one-way-trip to exit the dimension! This config option is set to off by default.
			-Fixed bug where if you change the worldgen configs in you entered a world and before going into the Ultra Amplified Dimension, the spawn chunks around the portal will use the default settings instead of the new settings. Now it should all be correct.
			Teleportation:
			-Teleporting to and from Ultra Amplified Dimension now resets the falling time on the player. So if you are fall fast but manage to click the portal block, you'll teleport to the other dimension and not take fall damage. Could make a neat mini-game mechanic! Rain and Thunder time is still locked into the Overworld's rain and thunder time.
			-Cleaned up the teleporting code so that it doesn't fire for all right clicks and only runs the checks/teleporting when right clicking the portal block.
			-Portal will not be created if you crouch right click with the activation item. Now you have to be standing.
			-The Amplified Portal Block will now spawn a ton of flame particles when created because it's cool!
			Misc:
			-Forge 1.15.2-31.1.29 pushed a fix for the server.properties so that it now actually works! Put "level-type=ultra_amplified" into the server.properties to generate a world using Ultra Amplified worldtype! As of now, "use-modded-worldtype=ultra-amplified" entry is no longer supported.
			-Fix en_us.json translation for some biomes.
