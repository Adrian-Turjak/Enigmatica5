			 * Builder fixes (#4404) This PR aims to improve some builder handling:
			Always call the connectBlockToBuilding even if we already have it. This allows to re-register things if they failed earlier.
			Some blocks like glasspains might get lost in an upgrade only because the new glasspane got a different blockstate. We should avoid this. * hotfix hospital recipe * hotfix raider crash * add loottable and recipe * Feature/hospital (#4396)
			This adds some new mechanic to the game: Diseases
			Citizens may now get certain diseases.
			What kind of diseases and what they can be cured with can be configured in the config file. How often a citizen gets a disease can also be configured Certain jobs have an increased risk The more citizens a colony have the higher the risk is too. There is a random chance for citizens to heal miraculously There is now a hospital:
			Healer worker heals citizens with illnesses For that he requests the cure items from the colony There is a random chance (depending on his level) to heal citizens without needing the cure Citizens with low HP < 2 hearts also go to the hospital to get healed Healer also heals players with low HP if the healer has nothing to do it will go visit the colony to find citizens with low HP closeby (40 blocks distance per building level). Changes proposed in this pull request: Adds diseases and healer Fix placement handler for barrackstower substitution blocks Fix University Research switching

	Patchouli (Patchouli-1.15.2-1.2-27.jar --> Patchouli-1.15.2-1.2-28.jar):
		Patchouli-1.15.2-1.2-28.jar:
			- Reintroduce quick lookup feature from old botania lexicon
			- Advancement locking now piggybacks off the vanilla advancement packet. As a result, "advancement_namespaces" is no longer required, and entries can now be gated on vanilla advancements

		Patchouli-1.15.2-1.2-27-FABRIC.jar:
			Fabric version of Patchouli 1.2-27.
			This Fabric port is mostly unsupported except in the case of major gamebreaking bugs. Please reproduce any minor bugs with the Forge version before reporting.
