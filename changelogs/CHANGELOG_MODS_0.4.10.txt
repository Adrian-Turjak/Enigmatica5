			Minecolonies Changelog
			Version: 0.11.941-ALPHA
			* Feature/stripped lumberjack (#4925)
			Feature Suggestion The new (awesome) Asian building style requires a fair bit of stripped wood. Stripped variants of woods cannot be crafted, but must be made by right-clicking woods/logs with an axe. Which becomes old really quickly when the buildings require hundreds of them.
			It makes sense for the lumberjack to be able to craft stripped versions of logs.
			Draft implementation Lumberjack turns vanilla wood/log to stripped versions if a request for this exists in the request pipeline. The lumberjack hut's GUI shows the list of recipes (i.e. the stripped versions), but you can't remove them and you also can't teach new recipes.

			6.1.0 (12 May 2020)
			* Added support for Cyclic XP Juice in the Vacuum Module (XP augment)
			* Added config option to not display "flying" items when they're being transferred

			* Added a "Match Any" / "Match All" button to the module GUI - [https://github.com/desht/ModularRouters/issues/56](https://github.com/desht/ModularRouters/issues/56)
			* - "Match Any" acts as previously and is the default - used in the vast majority of cases
			* - "Match All" requires all items in the filter to match - useful e.g. to match "enchanted leather boots"
			* Added an extra Player Module option: "Main Inventory (no Hotbar)" - [https://github.com/desht/ModularRouters/issues/73](https://github.com/desht/ModularRouters/issues/73)
			* - This will completely ignore the player's hotbar slots when transferring items to/from the main inventory
			* Fixed the Extruder Mk2 Module just breaking everything its path when extending - [https://github.com/desht/ModularRouters/issues/74](https://github.com/desht/ModularRouters/issues/74)
			* - It's supposed to stop at (non-replaceable) blocks, just like the Extruder Mk1
			* Fixed NPE triggered by other mods passing a null world/pos to certain Block methods they shouldn't - [https://github.com/desht/ModularRouters/issues/72](https://github.com/desht/ModularRouters/issues/72)
			* Fixed the "show module info" keybind (bound to "I" by default) not working in Router and Module GUI's (worked OK in default inventory screen)

			The format is based on [Keep a Changelog]([https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/]()),
			and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning]([https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html]()).

			### Added
			* Fog color for oil and diesel (DcZipPL) [#74]
			* Pipes (not functioning yet)
			### Fixed
			* Machine recipes showing their items in the recipe book [#77]
			* Crash in WireNetworkManager [#75]
			* Blaze rod duplication [#64]
			## [0.7.0] - 2020-02-04
			Ported to Minecraft 1.15.2
			## [0.6.13] - 2020-02-04
			### Changed
			* Updated more textures (futurenp)
			### Fixed
			* Wires not connecting to some blocks (more work needed) [#62]
			* Drying rack not interacting with some item transfer methods (missing item handler capability) [#55]
			## [0.6.12] - 2020-01-21
			### Removed
			* Some old recipes leftover from earlier versions. These were left in-place because ores were added later on.
			### Changed

			## [0.6.11] - 2019-12-31
			### Added
			* Temporary texture for hand pump
			* Russian translation (Smollet777)
			### Removed
			* "Inventory" text from machine screens [#41]
			### Changed

			### Fixed
			* Ethane and polyethylene buckets missing fluid capability (not working with Refined Storage) [#49, #41]

			* Drying rack can be waterlogged (will not function when waterlogged)
			* Set minimum Forge version to 28.1.5
			### Fixed
			* Drying racks interacting weirdly with hoppers (duplicating items, not updating on client) [#30]
			* Single wires not functioning [#11]

			## [0.6.1] - 2019-09-27
			### Added
			* Canisters, stackable fluid containers (64 per slot). This will hold any fluid, but probably won't be recognized by other mods.
			* Fluid color is currently pulled from some JEI code until I write my own solution. If you report colorless fluids in canisters I will make fun of you :p
			* Pump, picks up fluids from the world. Can fill buckets or canisters. Requires some FE to work
			* Refinery is working
			* Refinery can fill buckets or fluid canisters

			* Oil, generates in "lakes", usually underground. No function at the moment.
			* Diesel, will be one product of refining oil. Currently no way to produce it.
			* Refinery, not functional. Will refine oil into other fluids. Has a "recipe" system which will allow mods or datapacks to use it.
			### Changed
			* Coal generator now also accepts `forge:nuggets/coal` [#18]
			### Fixed
			* Ores generating in wrong generation stage [#19]

			* ComputerCraft (CC Tweaked) computers can now read energy levels of machines and generators
			### Changed
			* Generators can now be controlled by redstone like machines (defaults to ignore redstone)
			* Coal generator now accepts only coal and charcoal (`minecraft:coals`) and coal blocks (`forge:storage_blocks/coal`) by default. Override the `silents_mechanisms:coal_generator_fuels` item tag if you need to change this.
			## [0.4.2] - 2019-08-24
			### Added
			* Machines can now be controlled by redstone (defaults to ignore redstone). Does not work on generators yet, expect it next update.
			* Machine frames (no use yet), Electrum
			### Changed
			* Machines are now set to their inactive state (and lose progress) when they run out of power
			### Fixed
			* Alloy smelter matching the wrong recipes
			## [0.4.1] - 2019-08-23

			### Changed
			* Updated Polish translation (Dolores_McDoodle)
			### Fixed
			* Blocks losing their inventory when broken [#4]
			## [0.4.0] - 2019-08-22
			* Big thanks to EnbyChu for making all the textures for this update!
